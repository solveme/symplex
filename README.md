This program implements modified symplex method.
You can see example of its work in example.txt.
If you interested directly in implementation of symplex method,
you should look to src/functions.c (iteration(), make_standard() and make_canonic() functions)

I'm not professional programmer and wrote this program as a part of my thesis,
so i will be happy to see any comments, about quality of this code (i guess it's not good, but i tried hard).
